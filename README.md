# franciscan.university
A material design inspired, mobile-first, one-page website for Franciscan University of Steubenville geared toward prospective students.
Live site: https://franciscan.university

TODO:
- Convert .sass to .scss
- Improve site load times (especially on mobile)
- Customize materialize.js by removing unused code
- Customize materialize.css by removing unused styles
- Improve desktop design
- Add subtle(!) scroll animation to some elements on the page
- Refactor app.js to be as efficient as possible

Please submit all pull requests on seperate branches. PR's that change a lot of things at once are less likely to be merged.
