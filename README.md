# MA Theology One Page Site
A material design inspired, mobile-first, one-page website for Franciscan University of Steubenville geared toward prospective MA Theology students.
Live site: https://franciscan.university/ma-theology

TODO:
- Customize materialize.js by removing unused code
- Add subtle(!) scroll animation to some elements on the page
- Refactor app.js to be as efficient as possible

Please submit all pull requests on seperate branches. PR's that change a lot of things at once are less likely to be merged.
